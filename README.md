# styles
Example style files that can be used with OneGeology data to produce maps coloured according to some standard schemes

The initial content consists of Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) files taken from http://www.onegeology.org/wmsCookbook/7_4_5.html that can be used with SLD enabled WMS and other software to colour data using certain property names for age and lithology and IUGS-CGI or INSPIRE vocabulary values for them. These were written for GeoSciML-Portrayal v2.0 and need updating.

Licence to be decided.
